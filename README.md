# TypeScript [Plug’n’Play](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/pnp) Language Service plugin

TypeScript language service plugin for [Plug’n’Play](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/pnp).

Unlike regular language service plugins you can't enable it in your `tsconfig.json` file, because
TypeScript would have to resolve it with standard resolution algorithm first. Instead use a
[Visual Studio Code extension](https://github.com/ark120202/vscode-typescript-pnp-plugin).
